# MovieSearch
an iOS app that use OMDB database to search and save favorite movies


## Creative Portion
1. Used data encoding to encode the movie object
2. For favorite view, I displayed poster, title, and year produced in table view so it looks much nicer than just string
3. Desplayed all the data from query in movie detail controller
4. Did auto layout


## Notes
+ For better integration, I chose to use same view in favorite movies and search movies.
+ For some movie without poster, I used a blank poster to hold the place
